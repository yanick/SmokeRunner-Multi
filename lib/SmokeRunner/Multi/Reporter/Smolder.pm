=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $reporter =
      SmokeRunner::Multi::Reporter::Smolder->new( runner => $runner );

  $reporter->report();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements test reporting by reporting to a Smolder
installation.

=head1 METHODS

This class provides the following methods:

=head2 SmokeRunner::Multi::Reporter::Smolder->new(...)

This method creates a new reporter object. It requires one parameter:

=over 4

=item * runner

A C<SmokeRunner::Multi::Runner> object. You should already have called
C<< $runner->run_tests() >> on this object.

This runner object must be a C<SmokeRunner::Multi::Runner::Smolder>
object.

=back

Additionally, it expects to find Smolder configuration information in
the config file. This information should include "server" "username",
and "password" keys.

  smolder:
    server: smolder.example.com
    username: someone
    password: something

If this config data is not present, the constructor will die.

=head2 $reporter->report()

This executes F<smolder_smoke_signal> to actually report the test
results. It uses the configuration information found in the config
file for the appropriate executable arguments.

The set's name will be passed to F<smolder_smoke_signal> as the value
for "--project".

This will fail if it cannot find a F<smolder_smoke_signal> executable
in your path, since this is needed to actually do the reporting.
