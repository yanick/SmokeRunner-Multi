=head1 NAME

SmokeRunner::Multi::Reporter::Screen - Prints runner output to STDOUT

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $reporter =
      SmokeRunner::Multi::Reporter::Screen->new( runner => $runner );

  $reporter->report();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements test reporting by simply printing the output
from the runner to STDOUT. It can be handy if you're trying to debug
the SmokeRunner code, or your tests fails mysteriously under the smoke
runner but not when run by hand.

=head1 METHODS

This class provides the following methods:

=head2 SmokeRunner::Multi::Reporter::Smolder->new(...)

This method creates a new reporter object. It requires one parameter:

=over 4

=item * runner

A C<SmokeRunner::Multi::Runner> object. You should already have called
C<< $runner->run_tests() >> on this object.

=back

=head2 $reporter->report()

This simply prints the return value of C<< $runner->output() >>.
