NAME
    SmokeRunner::Multi - Manage smoke tests across multiple
    branches/checkouts/projects

VERSION
    version 0.18

SYNOPSIS
      use SmokeRunner::Multi;

      my $runner = SmokeRunner::Multi->new();

      $runner->run_and_report_next_set();

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution was created to help manage the running of automated
    tests across multiple branches or checkouts.

    Each branch is called a "test set", and sets are ordered based on
    various criteria. This class provide a high-level interface for getting
    the next set, running its tests, and reporting on them.

    Also see the smokerunner-multi script that comes with this distribution.

METHODS/FUNCTIONS
    This class provides the following methods:

  SmokeRunner::Multi->new()
    Creates a new object.

  $smoker->next_set()
    Returns the next test set to be run.

  $smoker->run_and_report_next_set()
    This is a convenience method that can be used to run and report on the
    next test set in a single step.

    As a convenience (mostly for testing), it returns the reporter object it
    creates internally.

  $smoker->make_runner( ... )
    This is a convenience method for making a "SmokeRunner::Multi::Runner"
    object of the class specified in the config file. Any parameters passed
    to this method will be passed on to the Runner class's constructor.

  $smoker->make_reporter( ... )
    This is a convenience method for making a
    "SmokeReporter::Multi::Reporter" object of the class specified in the
    config file. Any parameters passed to this method will be passed on to
    the Reporter class's constructor.

CONFIGURATION
    See SmokeRunner::Multi::Config for details on configuring the smoke
    runner. You need to create a minimal config file to do much of anything.
