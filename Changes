- More test fixes to work with even newer versions of prove.

- Only run pod tests when making distro, not when installing.


0.14    2008-08-05

- Test fixes to work with the latest Test::Harness. Now requires
  Test::Harness 3.0+. Failure reported by Zrusilla. RT #38152.


0.13    2007-06-02

- Changed the tests so that none of them rely on the existence of
  external programs. Also removed the fake executables in t/bin in
  favor of mocking subroutines for testing.

- The TestSet::SVN constructor no longer checks for an svn executable,
  and the Reporter::Smolder constructor no longer checks for
  smolder_smoke_signal. This check will be done when the programs are
  needed. This simplifies testing.


0.12    2007-06-02

- Enabled recursive test files in Build.PL so that all the tests are
  run.

- Many of the tests failed when prove was not in your path during the
  test runs. Thanks to David Cantrell for the test report.

- Fixed the Runner/Smolder.t test.

- Shut up warnings from Runner::Smolder when running the
  Runner/Smolder.t tests.


0.11    2007-06-01

- This release only contains doc changes. The docs referred to a
  nonexistent Runner class, TAPModel, in a bunch of places. This was
  the predecessor to the Smolder Runner.


0.10    2007-06-01

- Initial release
